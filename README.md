# GardenZoo

## Description
Development progress of my personal project, Garden Zoo made in Unity with C#. Heavily inspired by the viva pinata games made by Rare.

## Demo
You can try out an early version of the game by downloading the zip file named demo (Windows only right now sorry!)

## Planning
All planning is done with a Kanban board (Below is a screenshot of an intance of it)
